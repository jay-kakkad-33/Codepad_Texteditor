<br>
There many features in this textedtior from which some are similar to the Nodepad and some are add ons to the notepad features.
## Here's the list of features which are different than notepad.
#### 1. Themes :
- You can set theme from theme options in menu.
### 2.Run :
- Run feature is not at that level that (right not may be inhanced in future) but if you have an  html file opened in the editor it will run it it the default browser. If you are working on a python file with gui it will run it if there are no errors😅.
